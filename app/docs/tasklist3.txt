Task List for Iteration 3
# Task List Iteration 3

1. Working with the central server (Hami)
-----------------------------------
- All event publications and modifications should be stored on the
 central server, accessed through MeetlyServer and MeetlyServerImpl.

2. Fetching new events (Hami)
-------------------------
- At regular intervals, the app should fetch new events from the central
 server.
- New events must indicate that they are unviewed in the event list until the
 user views them.
- Events that the logged in user did not create must not be modifiable.

3. Displaying updated events (Alex)
-----------------------------
- When a viewed event has been modified on the central server, the event
 list must indicate that the event has changed until the user views them.

4. Controlling server updates (Alex)
------------------------------
- Suppose the user is viewing the event list.
- The user selects an "options menu" and configures the update frequency.
 - The app now scans for updates with the selected frequency, in minutes.
- The user returns to the event list.
- The user presses a button for updating the event list immediately.
 - The app fetches any new events from the server immediately.

5. Scheduling around conflicts (Jasdeep)
-------------------------------
- Assume the user has logged in and created an event.
- Suppose some other published event conflicts with the chosen time for
 the created event.
- Upon choosing to share a the first event, a warning dialog appears with a
 list of events scheduled at the same time.
- The user can choose to cancel the publication and edit the event or
 continue publishing the event anyway.
