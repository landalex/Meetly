# Task List Iteration 2
Scrum master: Alex Land

## Logging In and Logging Out
- Log in/log out to central server from events screen
- Display username on events screen when logged in
- Persistent sessions (user stays logged in)
- Dialog to notify user if login failed, allow them to try again or dismiss

## Sharing a Planned Event - Alex
- List events as unshared if they are not shared, shared if they are
- Ability to share events with central server if user logged in

## Sharing a Spontaneous - Alex
- Ability to share events as spontaneous events
- Broadcast to users nearby currently running the app
- List event as "spontaneous" on the events screen

## Editing a Planned Event
- Edit an existing event from the original creation screen (ie. use CreateEvent)
- Submit changes to central server, save event locally
- A user cannot change an event they did not create
- Server can decline to update the event, event does not get changed

## Internationalization
- All strings have a translated equivalent
- Choose one non-English language to support (I vote for pig latin or klingon)


# Possible Extra Helper Classes

## Server Helper - Alex
- Log in/Log out
- Publish/modify event

## WiFi Direct Helper (I have not researched this, am just brainstorming functionality)
### Sending data
- Search for other devices
- Connect to a device
- Share event with device
### Receiving data
- Listen for other devices that are sharing
- Receive event data
- Relay event to other devices nearby?
	For example, a device receives an event, then searches for devices around it, and sends the event to those devices too. Events should have a unique ID from the server so that other devices can reject broadcasted events if they are in range of multiple devices ( relaying shouldn't create duplicate events on phones that receive the event from more than one device)
